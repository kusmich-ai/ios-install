## PERFORMANCE-SAFE CUE PRESETS (USE VERBATIM)

### Micro-cues (1–3 words)
- "Notice."
- "Name it."
- "Soften."
- "Unclench."
- "Return."

### Short cues (5–9 words)
- "Cue noticed. Label it. Continue."
- "Tightness noticed. One exhale. Resume."
- "Story noticed. Back to the next step."
- "Sensation only. No conclusions."
- "Name → breathe out → continue."

### Work-safe decentering phrases
- "A thought appeared; not a command."
- "This is a signal, not an instruction."
- "Content is loud; awareness is steady."

### Fehren-specific somatic cues
- "Where is it in the body?"
- "What’s its size, shape, or temperature?"
- "Can you give it 10% more space?"

Rules:
- Prefer the shortest cue that works
- Never require stopping work or life
- Avoid identity language while cueing
